                    <p>First held in 776BC, the Olympic Games was a religious and athletic festival that was held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece.  Competition was among representatives of several city states and Kingdoms of Ancient Greece. During a time of war it was established that all hostilities were to be ceased whilst the games took place. According to legend it was Heracles who first called the games Olympic and established the custom of holding them once every four years. The first instance of medals being awarded to competitors was at the 1904 Summer Olympics.</p>
